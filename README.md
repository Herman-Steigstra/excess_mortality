# excess_mortality
An analysis of excess mortality based on age and sex; the possible role of Covid-19, deferred care and vaccines

We propose a different way of determining excess mortality. Our approach takes into account age and gender, but also under-mortality that you would expect after a period of excess mortality. After all, if this under-mortality does not seem to be happening, it is actually hidden excess mortality. The purpose of a better excess mortality estimate is first and foremost to determine whether this excess mortality is real. In addition, it is about finding clues about the cause such as Covid-19, delayed care or vaccinations. We note that excess mortality in the Netherlands remains consistently high during 2020 â€“ 2022 and has shifted from high to low age and towards men. Here, we discuss the implications of these findings in the light of the possible causes of excess mortality.
